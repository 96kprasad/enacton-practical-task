# Testing & Future Improvements

## Test Cases with Instructions

### Test Coverage Overview
This project includes comprehensive unit tests for critical components and hooks using Jest and React Testing Library.

### Test Files & Coverage

#### 1. **useFavorites Hook Tests** (`tests/useFavorites.test.ts`)
**Test Cases:**
- Initial state should be empty array
- Should load favorites from localStorage on mount
- Should toggle favorite status correctly
- Should persist favorites to localStorage
- Should handle invalid localStorage data gracefully
- Should clear all favorites with bulk remove
- Should check if launch is favorite correctly

#### 2. **LaunchCard Component Tests** (`tests/LaunchCard.test.tsx`)
**Test Cases:**
- Should render launch card with correct data
- Should display launch name and mission number
- Should show correct status indicator
- Should handle favorite toggle on heart icon click
- Should call onClick when card is clicked
- Should display mission patch image when available
- Should show fallback when no image available

### Running Tests - Complete Instructions

#### Basic Test Commands
```bash
# Run all tests once
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode (recommended for development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test useFavorites.test.ts

# Run tests matching pattern
npm test -- --testNamePattern="should toggle favorite"
```

#### Alternative with Yarn
```bash
yarn test
yarn test:watch
yarn test:coverage
```

## Potential Improvements

### 1. **Performance Enhancements**
- **Virtualization**: Implement `react-window` for handling 1000+ launches efficiently
- **Code Splitting**: Add dynamic imports for better bundle optimization
- **Image Optimization**: Implement lazy loading and WebP format support
- **Memoization**: Add React.memo for expensive components

### 2. **Feature Expansions**
- **Advanced Search**: Add filters for rocket type, mission outcome, and date ranges
- **Sorting Options**: Include popularity, success rate, and payload mass sorting
- **Export Functionality**: Allow users to export favorite launches as JSON/CSV
- **Launch Notifications**: Real-time notifications for upcoming launches

### 3. **User Experience Improvements**
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes with system preference detection
- **Responsive Design**: Enhanced mobile experience with touch gestures
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions for better UX
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support

### 4. **Technical Improvements**
- **PWA Support**: Service worker for offline functionality and app-like experience
- **Error Boundaries**: Better error handling with user-friendly fallbacks
- **Monitoring**: Add analytics and error tracking (Sentry, Google Analytics)
- **SEO Optimization**: Meta tags, structured data, and server-side rendering

### 5. **Testing Enhancements**
- **E2E Testing**: Cypress or Playwright for full user journey testing
- **Visual Regression**: Screenshot testing for UI consistency
- **Performance Testing**: Lighthouse CI integration for performance monitoring
- **API Mocking**: MSW (Mock Service Worker) for reliable API testing

### Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Virtualization, Dark Mode, Enhanced Mobile UX
2. **Medium Priority**: Advanced Filtering, PWA Support, E2E Testing
3. **Low Priority**: Export Features, Analytics, Visual Regression Testing
